          Tainted Forgotten is completely invulnerable, immobile and does not have a health bar. Colliding with Tainted Forgotten will cause Tainted Soul to hold it over its head, and pressing any of the fire buttons will throw the skeletal body in a given direction to attack.</p>
        <h3>Tainted Bethany</h3>
        <p>Tainted Bethany starts with 3 soul hearts, 6 blood charges, and  Lemegeton in the consumable slot.

        <h3>Tainted Jacob</h3>
        <p>Tainted Jacob spawns with 3 red heart containers and Anima Sola in his consumable slot. Anima Sola freezes the nearest enemy for 5 seconds. However, he is pursued through the entire game by Dark Esau, who will try to charge into and kill Tainted Jacob. Anima Sola always affects Dark Esau if he is on screen.
